# PA-2
This is a compilation of my work and journal in coding the problems in PA 2

>for the first problem, I simply followed the instructions and used the provided syntax which is .std and .mean then I had a gap knowledge about saving a file which then I discovered it was .save

>for the second problem, I had a slight problem constructing the array with squared numbers, but fortunately, I remembered that there was a way to reshape the array.
